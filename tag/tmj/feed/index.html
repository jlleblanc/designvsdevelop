				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, I had pain in the right side of my mouth, so I went to see a doctor. She diagnosed me with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporomandibular_joint_disorder">TMJ disorder</a> and I&#8217;m currently waiting to see a dentist. I&#8217;ve been taking her advice by going on a soft foods diet where I can&#8217;t eat anything firmer than ground beef. This is rather difficult for me as I&#8217;m a reasonably adventurous eater and like playing chef. I&#8217;m having to get creative with the recipes and my diet. While cupcakes and doughnuts are certainly soft foods, you can&#8217;t make a meal out of them. Nutrition has been a big concern of mine over the past week as I want my body to have the nutrients it needs to help repair the joint. Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been eating:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soup.</strong> Usually cooked down to a non-chewing consistency anyway, but watch out for vegetable and bean skins.</li>
<li><strong>Strawberries.</strong> They&#8217;re just coming into season around the country, so some fresh ones have been available.</li>
<li><strong>Milk (soy and dairy).</strong> Helps with the protein intake.</li>
<li><strong>Tofu.</strong> Made some soup out of this and had some at a Thai restaurant on Friday.</li>
<li><strong>V8.</strong> Raw vegetables are out of the question, so I&#8217;m using this to play catch up.</li>
<li><strong>Food processor.</strong> Taking favorites and grinding them up is fun, although not always as appetizing <img src="http://www.designvsdevelop.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </li>
</ul>
