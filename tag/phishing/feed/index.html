				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve probably received fraudulent emails from people posing to be a bank wanting you to log in to your account. A few weeks ago, I received a phone call from an automated machine claiming to be my bank with a message for me. It then asked for the last four digits of my social security number; hung up immediately and decided that I would call my bank later.</p>
<p>Today, I received a similar phone call and hung up again. I called my bank right away and they confirmed with the security department that they did not place this phone call. Had I given this information, who knows what would have happened?</p>
<p><strong>REMEMBER</strong>: only give personal information when <strong>you initiate</strong> a phone call with a trusted number. <strong>NEVER</strong> give your personal information when someone <strong>calls you</strong>.</p>
