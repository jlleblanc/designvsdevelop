				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been in the United States for a couple of weeks now. The jet lag is over. A considerable amount of Mexican food has been consumed. Pennsylvania is in the middle of the “not quite winter, not quite spring” season. Facebook shows what all of my Filipino friends are doing, but it’s not the same as being there. And I’ve spent time reflecting on the internship as a whole.</p>
<p>Then one day, it hit me: this would have made the <em>perfect</em> reality TV series. We had team tasks every week, a host, a wide mix of people, and an unfamiliar environment. You could have rolled the cameras, added a few “honesty cam” interviews, and tied it all together with strategically placed music. Then we could have used royalties from the show to fund all of the missionaries!</p>
<p>Thankfully, the internship was <strong>not</strong> a reality TV series. Nobody was voted off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panay">Panay Island</a> and nobody went home until the end. No one walked around with an attitude of “immunity.” <a href="http://anascomissions.org">Dave</a> was not ranking us and deciding who would be eliminated next.</p>
<p>The entire point of the internship was for us to grow and learn by doing things as a <em>team</em>. You can’t effectively do all of those things when you try to perform, show off, and make yourself noticed. You have to listen to everyone and think of them <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A3&amp;version=NIV">as better than yourself</a>. And you have to rely on God’s power working through you, not your own talents and strengths.</p>
<p>So while nobody made a reality series based on our internship, there were cameras around. <a href="http://gotonations.org/adorada">Nomil</a> not only made a movie out of our footage, he also made a trailer!</p>

<p>So, what’s next on the agenda? I’m never too far from the Joomla! community, so I’m returning to <a href="http://jandbeyond.org">J! and Beyond</a> for 2011. Then after three days of friends and geekery, I’m taking a side trip to pay a long overdue visit to <a href="http://mustardseedkosovo.blogspot.com/">Landon and Lacey</a> in Kosovo!</p>
