				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have another How To Joomla article up: <a href="http://www.howtojoomla.net/how-tos/development/how-to-debug-your-joomla-code-with-firephp">How to debug our Joomla code with FirePHP</a>. Just recently, I discovered a plugin that painlessly adds FirePHP to your Joomla site. After installing it and doing some tests, I decided to write an article. In the midst of writing the article, I went to the <a href="http://www.firephp.org/Wiki/Libraries/Joomla">FirePHP wiki</a> and found another <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/miscellaneous/development/11343">FirePHP plugin for Joomla</a> released by the Kunena team. This one is even better, with tighter integration into the Joomla environment. I see many possibilities for model debugging and exception handling down the road.</p>
<p>Drupal and WordPress also have FirePHP plugins, as do most of the major stand-alone PHP frameworks. <a href="http://www.firephp.org/Wiki/">Have a look</a> to see if your favorite is listed before trying to hack FirePHP into your next project.</p>

If you&#8217;ve used Joomla since the 1.0 days, you may recall that content plugins acted on both articles and Custom HTML modules. In 1.5, this behavior changed so that Content plugins only act on articles from the Article Manager. Fortunately, there are several options for regaining and controlling this functionality, which I outline in the post. Head over and let me know what you think!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I originally received my copy of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1847198147?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jolle-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1847198147">Joomla! 1.5 Development Cookbook</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jolle-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1847198147" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />, I was in the middle of a large client project. The book sat over on my shelf for a few days waiting to be read. While working on my code, I came to a point where I wanted to add some custom markup to the  portion of the HTML document. Although I usually whip out my Joomla Textmate bundle to pull up the right snippet, this wasn’t something I already had preprogrammed and ready to go.</p>
<h3 id="if_i_learned_something_you8217ll_learn_something">If I learned something, you’ll learn something</h3>
<p>I was about to do a Google search, but suddenly remembered that James’ book was in arm’s reach and might have the answer. After turning to the index and finding the topic, I quickly located the exact code I needed to move on. Despite having written a book on Joomla myself, this one came to my rescue at just the right time!</p>
<p>While it took me a while to read all 130 recipes (including time on airplanes, buses, and sitting in my living room), the practical tips and methods were worth it. James covers a wide breadth of Joomla programming topics, matched only by his Joomla Framework reference. Most passages are 2-3 pages long and include relevant information that’s quickly applicable to any Joomla project you’re working on.</p>
<h3 id="essential_information">Essential information</h3>
<p>Two chapters in this book really make it a must-purchase for any Joomla developer. The Multilingual Recipes chapter gives more in-depth information on internationalization and character encodings than any other Joomla reference I’ve seen. Even if you’re only creating a website in one language, it’s imperative that you understand how character encodings work. Current versions of PHP have some shortcomings with handling UTF-8 strings, but Joomla’s special libraries will help you handle them correctly.</p>
<p>Character encodings aside, Keeping it Extensible and Modular is the most useful chapter in the entire book. This chapter is devoted to helping you work with Joomla’s different extension types and getting around some of the shortcomings in 1.5. For instance, James shows you how to create installable libraries by creating a custom type of plugin.</p>
<p>Also, this chapter has a recipe for using the component installation process to install additional extensions. This method allows you to include your modules and plugins inside of your component package; installing multiple extensions in one click. I plan on using it as soon as I get a chance to work on the Podcast Suite!</p>
<p>While the content in this book is very strong, it does have a couple of drawbacks. While most of the recipes have readily usable code that’s straightforward, a few of them don’t make a strong case for why you would use the described method. For instance, there’s a recipe on creating and raising a custom error level. It goes into how you want to avoid conflicting with Joomla and PHP error codes, but it doesn’t explain why you would want to create a custom error level in the first place. Fortunately, most of the recipes have more context.</p>
<h3 id="i8217m_willing_to_read_more_than_two_pages8230_seriously">I’m willing to read more than two pages… seriously.</h3>
<p>The biggest disappointment of this book is in the execution of the cookbook format. Having read other “programming cookbooks” in the past, I know that the goal of these kinds of books is to help you find relevant information on specific topics quickly. However, Packt seems to have decided that providing “quick information” means catering to readers with severe cases of attention deficit disorder.</p>
<p>If you try to read entire chapters of this book at a time, you’ll notice that some recipes are almost identical.  In Chapter 7, there are individual recipes on setting the HTML document generator, description, and metadata. These add up to less than three pages, but all include the same introduction at the beginning of each. Additionally, all three of these include “See also” references to each other. These would have worked much better as a combined recipe, including a reasonable scenario where you would want to set these things. In its current form, almost half of your reading consists of headers and duplicated information.</p>
<p>I get the feeling that Packt was trying to break all of the topics up into the tiniest pieces possible. This way, they’re able to slap “130 simple but incredibly useful recipes” on the cover and advertise a page count of over 300. This is really taking a short view of things, as James did a wonderful job with the topics he covered. While some marketer is probably pushing for a specific length, I’ve found that the length of a book is not proportional to its usefulness. For instance, I learned far more in 145 pages of Javascript: The Good Parts than I did in nearly 800 pages of Programming Ruby.</p>
<h3 id="hidden_joomla_treasures">Hidden Joomla treasures</h3>
<p>Despite the sometimes choppy format, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1847198147?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jolle-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1847198147">Joomla! 1.5 Development Cookbook</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jolle-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1847198147" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> organizes a lot of how-tos missing from Joomla’s online documentation. Anyone coding anything more than the simplest module can benefit from the recipes in this book. James demonstrates expert programming knowledge and delivers it in a very accessible format. The time you’ll save by having this information at hand will offset the cost of purchasing it within the first week. If you’re writing code for Joomla, <strong>you need this book</strong>.</p>
<p>UPDATE: you can also read a <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/files/8143-joomla-1-5-development-cookbook-sample-chapter-2-keeping-extensions-secure.pdf">PDF sample</a> of Chapter 2 from Packt&#8217;s website.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Packt Publishing recently sent me a review copy of Joomla 1.5 Template Design by Tessa Blakeley Silver. Since I read most of it away from my computer, I wasn’t able to work through the examples. While I can’t speak to how well the code examples matched the actual process of building the template, I did enjoy reading the book. Coming in at 259 pages before the index, this book has enough content to cover everything you need to know while not wearing out its welcome.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">The strongest part shines in Chapter 2, where Tessa introduces her “Rapid Design Comping” technique. This markup-centric approach helps you get your typography and HTML right first, then goes back and creates accompanying graphics. By getting your basic HTML and CSS out of the way up front, you don’t run into issues where you’ve designed a layout in PhotoShop that doesn’t translate to the web. Her coverage of this method is easily worth the price of the whole book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">Another plus is that Tessa incorporates HTML and CSS validation as a part of your template design workflow. Although having valid markup does not guarantee that your design will display properly in all browsers, it does help you avoid many such inconsistencies from the outset. She also covers common browser hacks (mostly to accommodate Internet Explorer 6) and how to use them as sparingly as possible. Finally, she also dives into avoiding quirks mode rendering and how to handle inconsistent renderings of the box model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">Coverage of Joomla-specific code and techniques is extensive, including custom module chrome and template parameters. She includes a complete reference for all &lt;jdoc:include /&gt; tags, as well as CSS selectors output by the Joomla core. Joomla template-specific PHP is also explained, but without going too deep into code that might confuse people without a programming background.</span></p>
<p>Despite a strong foundation in the fundamentals of Joomla templating and HTML/CSS, the book does have faults. There are some places where Tessa states something pensively (for instance, date formatting in XML manifests on page 138) which makes you wonder whether or not she’s confident about what she’s describing. Conversely, her description of the Model-View-Controller design pattern is very confidently stated, but slightly inaccurate. Fortunately, she describes the relevant details of View overrides correctly. That said, a more consistent voice would make the book easier to read.</p>
<p>Less forgivable is the introduction of the jQuery JavaScript library in Chapter 8. While she does a good job of showing jQuery’s power and simplicity, not once does she mention that Joomla already includes MooTools. Worse, readers are not alerted to the fact that jQuery will clash with MooTools if you don’t add the proper workarounds. While I love jQuery as much as Tessa does (and perhaps more), I was quite shocked by the omission. It’s quite possible that Tessa hasn’t run into this conflict, but it does happen frequently.</p>
<p>Despite a few missteps, this book is a solid introduction to the ins and outs of building a template in Joomla. All of the standard syntax is covered, along with a practical overview of how to structure your HTML and CSS for optimal browser compatibility. Advanced topics are also tackled head on, making this book the most complete reference for building Joomla templates that I know of. If you need to build a template or are curious about the process, this book should definitely be on your shelf.</p>
<p>You can read a sample of the book from Packt&#8217;s <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/files/7160-Joomla-1-5-Template-Design-Sample-Chapter-Joomla-1-5-Template-Reference.pdf">website</a> [PDF], or <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/joomla-1-5-template-design-2nd-edition/book">purchase</a> the book there as well.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Framework conflicts are a common problem people run into when using jQuery. While jQuery provides some <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Using_jQuery_with_Other_Libraries">tricks you can use</a> to get around this, you may still run into issues when Joomla! generates MooTools effects. While writing the second edition of <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/learning-joomla!-1.5-extension-development/book">Learning Joomla! Extension Development</a>, I decided to do a chapter on JavaScript and look into this problem a little bit more closely. It turns out you have to make sure MooTools loads before jQuery, then use one of the tricks detailed on jquery.com.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this can be done in Joomla! consistenly, so I documented it. Packt decided to release the entire JavaScript chapter as the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/files/learning-joomla-1-5-extension-development-sample-chapter-8-using-javascript-effects.pdf">sample PDF</a> for my book, so you can read everything you need to know about implementing this technique for free!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While helping people get the Podcast Suite up and running, I&#8217;m noticing that a lot of people are running vulnerable, outdated copies of Joomla! 1.5.x. Keeping your Joomla! site running with the latest patches is a <strong>MUST</strong>. The Joomla! core team, working groups, security team, and bug squad all jump in and help write a patch whenver a vulnerability is discovered. However, these patches do no good if they are not applied to your site.</p>
<p>So how do you stay on top of Joomla! security issues and releases? The <a href="http://www.joomla.org/download.html">download</a> page for Joomla! now has a handy form where you can sign up for email alerts. If you prefer RSS, use <a href="http://feeds.joomla.org/JoomlaSecurityNews">this</a> feed link. <em>(BTW: the current version as of this writing is 1.5.7, with a 1.5.8 maintenance release around the corner.)</em></p>
