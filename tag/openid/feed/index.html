				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A month ago, I switched not only the theme and title of this blog, but also the software underneath from <a href="http://www.joomla.org">Joomla!</a> to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. I always intended to expand my Joomla! based blog into something more substantial; a new way of presenting and sorting information, opinions, reviews, and recommendations. However, I didn&#8217;t get very far in achieving this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, blogs have become so prevalent that people will assume you website is actually a blog if it feels somewhat like one. With this in mind, visitors have a certain expectation of how your &#8220;blog&#8221; will behave; if it doesn&#8217;t, people can get confused and possibly frustrated. So now I&#8217;m using blogging software instead of content management software.</p>
<p>Here are my impressions of WordPress. The user interface gets all the points for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</a>. Writing posts, seeing new comments, scanning incoming links, and adding images are all a pure joy! It&#8217;s also nice to see the autodraft saves so that you don&#8217;t accidentally lose your work. WordPress also has enough functionality for building a very basic non-blog website if you need one. Finally, I&#8217;m happy to see the WordPress folks following a web software convention I feel is crucial: the backend has an interface distinctly separate from the one seen in public. <em>(Not going to mention the names of any offenders here.)</em></p>
<p>However, not all is rosy with WordPress. Within hours of putting up my blog, dozens of spam comments were pouring in, making me wonder whether I should turn back before it was too late. Fortunately, they died down after a couple of days and a few keyword filters. I have comments set to be displayed only after the email and name have been approved. (If you use your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openid">OpenID</a>, your comment will appear automatically.)</p>
<p>The other gripe I have about WordPress is the templating. I took a peek to see if I could quickly throw together a basic theme to match my <a href="http://www.jlleblanc.com">main website</a>. Unfortunately, I was in for a rude surprise. While this isn&#8217;t the worst system I&#8217;ve seen, WordPress themes are broken into too many pieces in the wrong places, with poor internationalization to boot. It&#8217;s very irritating to work in a world where an HTML tag opens in one file and closes in another; this is just begging for mistakes to be made.</p>
<p>Despite these speed bumps, I&#8217;m definitely enjoying WordPress and will change the theme to something else once I find one that suits my tastes (or have time to build a new one).</p>
