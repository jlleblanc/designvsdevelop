				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, one of my clients requested an invoice for my services. This is not an unreasonable request by any means, but it is oddly one that doesn&#8217;t happen very often. I initially fired up OpenOffice.org and started writing one, but had difficulty getting the layout I wanted. After OpenOffice crashed (I had an older version), I postedÂ <a href="http://twitter.com/jlleblanc/status/2497065708">a message</a> to Twitter. Suddenly I had friends suggesting FreshBooks, Zoho Invoice, Billable, and some homebrew solution. Many of these were good suggestions, but I was really just looking for a nice clean invoice template; I already have my own system for tracking hours and payments.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have a very bad case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here">NIH</a> and decided to roll my own using HTML and CSS. Fortunately, it only actually took an hour and I&#8217;m quite pleased with the results. So pleased, that I&#8217;m now sharing the results for all of the Internet to plunder. <a href="http://www.designvsdevelop.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/invoice.html">Have a look</a>.

<p>I created a PDF of this using my Mac&#8217;s &#8220;Save as PDF&#8221; function under &#8220;Print&#8230;&#8221; on Firefox 3.5 and it worked perfectly. Safari wanted to print headers and footers with the source URL and didn&#8217;t pick up my backgrounds. I have not tested this in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
