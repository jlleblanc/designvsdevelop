				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout the life of the Podcast Suite, many of you have asked if you could make donations for the work I&#8217;ve put into it. Every time, I&#8217;ve redirected your kindness by suggesting a donation towards the Joomla project instead. I do this as the effort I put into the Suite is small when compared to the enormous effort put into Joomla itself. Without Joomla, the Podcast Suite would not exist.</p>
<p>However, if you have used the Podcast Suite and would still like to donate money, there is a current opportunity for you to make a tax-deductible donation that would help me greatly. At the last week of October, I will be flying with 12 other people from my <a href="http://www.capitallife.org">church</a> to Iloilo City, Philippines; we will be spending two weeks there to run a summer camp for street children. Each of us need to raise $2,300 for our trip expenses. You can read more about it in this (PDF) <a href="http://www.designvsdevelop.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Philippines.pdf">letter</a> and make a <a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/sp/d1/default.aspx?wid=27118">donation</a> here.</p>
<p>Any funds raised in excess of my $2,300 goal will go towards the goals of my other team members. Although I would be honored to receive money towards this goal from Suite users, do not feel any obligation to contribute towards this trip. I&#8217;m always thrilled to hear about the Suite being used. I want all Joomla users to be able to publish their own podcasts without knowing programming or RSS. When you publish a podcast with the Suite, you help me achieve that goal!</p>
