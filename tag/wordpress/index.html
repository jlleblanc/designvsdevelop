Spring &#8217;09 Conference Roundup</a>

<div class="art-PostHeaderIcons art-metadata-icons">
June 8th, 2009
</div>
<div class="art-PostContent">

          <p>It seems as though the tech conference season starts off every year with SXSW in Austin, comes to a peak in May, then takes a vacation until September. So far, this year has been no different. I recently had the opportunity to attend three conferences within four weeks of each other. A small taste of each follows&#8230;</p>
<h2>JSConf</h2>
<p>Back in February, I began seeing tweets for JSConf on April 24th-25th: the <a href="http://www.jsconf2009.com/">first conference</a> for JavaScript developers. I recently began digging into JavaScript for more than simple effects in jQuery so this sounded interesting. The venue was a mere two metro stops away from my apartment, so I knew I would be kicking myself if I didn&#8217;t go.</p>
<p>JSConf absolutely blew me away. The sessions were not simple &#8220;here&#8217;s how to use jQuery for form validation in your next project&#8221; talks. These were the first presentations I saw of JavaScript being used for <em>backend</em> programming as well as frontend. There were speakers representing Objective-J/Cappuccino, Dojo, jQuery, YUI, CouchDB, Titanium, and many other projects. This was also the first I had seen a formal presentation on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOSH">BOSH</a> and <a href="http://xmpp.org/">XMPP</a>.</p>
<p>Although there were the presentations about using JavaScript in the backend, the current mainstream use is in the front. Consequently, most of the attendees had expertise in languages other than JavaScript. JSConf managed to get Ruby, PHP, Python, .NET, and other developers in the same room. This really made the conference for me: we were forced to talk about our tools without hiding behind fanboyism.</p>
<p>Another highlight of JSConf was running into Chad Auld and Ozgur Cem Sen from the MiaCMS project. MiaCMS is a fork of the Mambo codebase that has some promising features developing. The JavaScript for the entire codebase has been rewritten in YUI. <a href="http://miacms.org/">MiaCMS</a> also sports a REST-style interface you can use to do things like update your site from an iPhone.</p>
<p>Aside from the incredible technical content, the accomodations and after parties were fantastic. Chris and Laura poured a lot of effort into putting this and thought of all the details. They made sure that outlets and wifi were plentiful. The venue they picked was just the right size for shuffling between sessions, uncon talks, hallway tracks, and break room hacking. They even organized a &#8220;significant other&#8221; track where spouses and children were able to tour DC and Old Town together.</p>
<p>There may be some who would say that this was great for a first year conference; I thought it was amazing for a second or third year conference. I know first hand how difficult it can be to pull off a tech conference, but Chris and Larua passed with flying colors. The sponsors were also incredibly generous and helped the event shine. Looking forward to JSConf 2010!</p>
<h2>WordCamp Mid-Atlantic</h2>
<p>While people may know me as &#8220;the Joomla! guy&#8221; in the DC tech community, I&#8217;m currently happily using WordPress to power this blog. WordPress is the best tool for doing a stand-alone blog, which is what Design vs. Develop has become. So I felt this was as good an excuse as any to show up for <a href="http://wordcampmidatlantic.com/">WordCamp Mid-Atlantic</a> on May 18th. (On the other hand, <a href="http://caseysoftware.com/">Keith</a> has never used WordPress and simply attended to steal ideas.)</p>
<p>WordCamp Mid-Atlantic (with the rather long Twitter hashtag #wordcampmidatl) was a nice mix between sessions about writing, marketing, and coding. A couple of big announcements from SixApart and the WordPress core team hit that day (TypePad Connect and WP 2.8 beta respectively). The venue was accessible and well-suited for formal talks as well as hallway tracks.</p>
<p>I applaud Aaron&#8217;s decision to move the event from DC to Baltimore and refocusing it as a regional conference instead of a city-centric event. DC&#8217;s tech community is now much more firmly established than 3-4 years ago. While it would have personally been more convenient to have something located in DC, we&#8217;re definitely at a point where we need to connect talent regionally as well as locally.</p>
<p>While the vast majority of the people attending were WordPress users, many were also proficient in Drupal, Joomla!, and other PHP-based systems. The recurring conversation seemed to be that we like using WordPress for straight-up blogs and simple sites, then reach for something else when we want something more involved. Although WordPress is billing itself as a publishing platform as well as a blog, I think we&#8217;ll continue to see people using different platforms for different sites. It&#8217;s gotten to the point where most are using WordPress for very simple sites (just pages with content), but using something else when integrated shopping carts and forums are wanted.</p>
<h2>php|tek</h2>
<p>Finally, I flew out to Chicago for <a href="http://tek.mtacon.com/">php|tek &#8217;09</a>. The guys over at <a href="http://www.phparch.com/">MTA</a> are seasoned conference organizers, with this event being no exception. There was a wide variety of talks: from using XMLReader, to alternative databases, Zend Framework hacks, and even an unconference session on PHP-GTK. As many have commented, php|tek is a nice blend between the PHP developer community and business community.</p>
<p>We had a hackathon where people were writing PHP tests for TestFest, but somehow I was convinced to write patches for <a href="http://trac2.assembla.com/phergie">Phergie</a> instead. Ok, so I was sitting at the table and was curious more than anything. Phergie is an IRC bot maintained by <a href="http://ishouldbecoding.com">Matthew Turland</a> that hangs around #phpc on Freenode. It&#8217;s quite a non-traditional use of PHP: you have a long-running process that essentially sits in one big loop. It was nice to sit down and write some code purely for fun <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Aside from the hackathon, you can read about the events and what I thought of them on <a href="http://joind.in/user/view/242">joind.in</a>. I didn&#8217;t get around to rating all of the sessions I went to, but most of the sessions seem to have been ranked by at least one person.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the wifi was a bit of a wash. I ended up paying for the hotel&#8217;s package the first day as I had some side work that needed to go out ASAP. The other days I was usually able to connect, but had difficulty during the hackathon and in the back rooms. However, I think most of the issue with wifi at conferences is the sheer number of heavy Internet users all hitting the same access points at once. As I&#8217;ve been telling everyone I meet, Apple should pioneer &#8220;conference mode&#8221; where you tell your laptop to stop doing backups, software updates, and any other non-crucial network activities.</p>
<p>The biggest announcement at the conference was that php|works, usually held in the fall, will be revamped as <a href="http://cw.mtacon.com/">CodeWorks 2009</a> and held in 7 cities (not all at the same time!). It will be an affordable, two-day conference held on a two-week, cross-country tour. I&#8217;m planning on going to the one here in the DC area.</p>
<p>In addition to MTA&#8217;s CodeWorks, <a href="http://stackoverflow.carsonified.com/">StackOverflow DevDay</a> will be held later that month. More tickets have been opened, so it&#8217;s not too late to register!</p>

<div class="art-PostHeaderIcons art-metadata-icons">
April 17th, 2009
</div>
<div class="art-PostContent">

          <p>I downloaded the <a href="http://concrete5.org/">concrete5</a> CMS a couple of weeks ago and intended to write a critique earlier, but am only now getting around to doing so. Since then, <a href="http://www.cmswire.com/cms/web-cms/drupal-and-joomla-to-lose-market-share-to-concrete5-web-cms-004347.php">this article</a> was released on CMS Wire and Joomla! fans on Twitter <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=concrete5+joomla">began talking</a>.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s good</h2>
<p>One common pitfall of CMSes is to abstract away the concept of a page. concrete5 avoids this and very much embraces pages. A+ in my book. While it&#8217;s true that some layer of abstraction can be helpful in certain cases (usually when you&#8217;re building an application inside of your CMS), it adds extra work for most webmasters.</p>
<p>Editing pages is also very straightforward. Once you&#8217;re in edit mode, all of the blocks (similar to Joomla! modules) appear with dotted borders. Clicking on one gives you several options for editing the block, including dragging and dropping the block to a new position. Very nicely done.</p>
<p>The features built around content5 are thoughtful. Versioning is built in and outputs diff-style coloring when comparing revisions. There are also extensions to help you embed videos, Google Maps, slide shows, and RSS feeds.</p>
<p>About 70% of the functionality you&#8217;ll need on a regular basis is contained in the toolbar that appears as you&#8217;re editing individual pages. For the rest, there&#8217;s a specific &#8220;dashboard&#8221; backend where you can go to manage themes and files, get reports, and perform other administrative tasks.</p>
<h2>Theming is okay</h2>
<p>The theming system is reasonable. Like Joomla!, you can add specific themes to specific pages. Closer to Drupal, your theme can define several different page types, which might eliminate the need for separate themes. However, concrete5 requires theme designers to instantiate objects within their markup, then call member functions of those objects to display output. This bothers me. It seems like static function calls or embedded tokens would handle this more elegantly.</p>
<p>Also, the greensalad example theme uses the &#8220;header.php at the top, footer.php at the bottom&#8221; style of breaking up the markup—I loathe this. There&#8217;s no reason to use this error-prone method for theming: you end up with tags that are opened in one file and closed in another.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s annoying</h2>
<p>While the simplicity of editing individual pages is definitely something I prefer, concrete5 has sacrificed some features to get there. I was not able to find any kind of feature to create a blog-style index of content made up of blurbs from other pages. <a href="http://www.concrete5.org/marketplace">Add-ons</a> are scarce: if you&#8217;re looking for a forum or shopping cart, you might be in for a wait until they attract more developers to the platform.</p>
<p>I ran into a few speed bumps when installing concrete5 locally. After downloading it and going to the installation screen, there was a checklist of PHP configuration settings necessary to run concrete5 (not unlike Joomla!&#8217;s). Most of them were good to go after tweaking folder permissions, but I did not have the GD library setup on my self-compiled version of PHP. I was a little surprised that the system would not let me continue installation. While I&#8217;m sure there are features in concrete5 that use server-side image processing, this doesn&#8217;t strike me as something so vital as to halt installation. (I was able to successfully install both GD and concrete5 on my spare Ubuntu machine.)</p>
<p>Although the GD dependency was annoying, the halted installation uncovers something even more so. If the installer detects even the slightest issue with your configuration, an advertisement for professional installation is displayed. Quite tacky; they could have at least provided a <a href="http://www.concrete5.org/community/forums/installation">link to their installation forum</a>.</p>
<p>Which brings us to community. This company oozes a know-it-all attitude. In sharp contrast to the websites of other CMSes, their official <a href="http://www.concrete5.org/about/">About</a> page openly bashes Joomla!, Drupal, and WordPress; painting all three in rather broad strokes. This is very disappointing, unnecessary, and ultimately counter-productive. I&#8217;m all for making bold statements, but they&#8217;re driving away the very people who could help their platform grow quickly.</p>
<h2>Final word</h2>
<p>concrete5 is a very promising CMS that does the basics very well. The interface is picked up quickly and things are easy to find. However, if they&#8217;re earnest about building a community around their code, they might want to tone down the self-worship a smidge. And is content management really a <a href="http://concretethestudio.com/">human right</a>?</p>

WordPress, one month later</a>

<div class="art-PostContent">

          <p>A month ago, I switched not only the theme and title of this blog, but also the software underneath from <a href="http://www.joomla.org">Joomla!</a> to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. I always intended to expand my Joomla! based blog into something more substantial; a new way of presenting and sorting information, opinions, reviews, and recommendations. However, I didn&#8217;t get very far in achieving this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, blogs have become so prevalent that people will assume you website is actually a blog if it feels somewhat like one. With this in mind, visitors have a certain expectation of how your &#8220;blog&#8221; will behave; if it doesn&#8217;t, people can get confused and possibly frustrated. So now I&#8217;m using blogging software instead of content management software.</p>
<p>Here are my impressions of WordPress. The user interface gets all the points for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS principle</a>. Writing posts, seeing new comments, scanning incoming links, and adding images are all a pure joy! It&#8217;s also nice to see the autodraft saves so that you don&#8217;t accidentally lose your work. WordPress also has enough functionality for building a very basic non-blog website if you need one. Finally, I&#8217;m happy to see the WordPress folks following a web software convention I feel is crucial: the backend has an interface distinctly separate from the one seen in public. <em>(Not going to mention the names of any offenders here.)</em></p>
<p>However, not all is rosy with WordPress. Within hours of putting up my blog, dozens of spam comments were pouring in, making me wonder whether I should turn back before it was too late. Fortunately, they died down after a couple of days and a few keyword filters. I have comments set to be displayed only after the email and name have been approved. (If you use your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openid">OpenID</a>, your comment will appear automatically.)</p>
<p>The other gripe I have about WordPress is the templating. I took a peek to see if I could quickly throw together a basic theme to match my <a href="http://www.jlleblanc.com">main website</a>. Unfortunately, I was in for a rude surprise. While this isn&#8217;t the worst system I&#8217;ve seen, WordPress themes are broken into too many pieces in the wrong places, with poor internationalization to boot. It&#8217;s very irritating to work in a world where an HTML tag opens in one file and closes in another; this is just begging for mistakes to be made.</p>
<p>Despite these speed bumps, I&#8217;m definitely enjoying WordPress and will change the theme to something else once I find one that suits my tastes (or have time to build a new one).</p>

A website resolution you can keep</a>

<div class="art-PostContent">

          <p>If you run a website, here&#8217;s a resolution you can keep: make sure your host is up to date. This is something that only takes a few minutes to check and can help you avoid hacker-induced headaches. With PHP being the most popular programming language used on the web, chances are your site uses it. You&#8217;re definitely using PHP if you use popular programs such as <a href="http://www.joomla.org">Joomla!</a>, <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>, or <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. Even if you keep these programs up to date with the latest patches, your site can still be at risk if your host doesn&#8217;t keep PHP itself updated.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re running Joomla! or Drupal, checking your current PHP version is easy. In Joomla! 1.0.x, log into the administrator backend and go to System &gt; System Info. The PHP version will be listed on this screen as well as under the PHP Info tab. In Drupal, use your admin login, then go to Administer &gt; Logs &gt; Status Report.</p>
<p>Aside from this software, there are other ways you can get the PHP version number. Most shared hosts often give you a control panel where you can log in and manage your account. If your host offers CPanel, the PHP version number will usually be displayed on the front page in the left column.</p>
<p>As a last resort, it&#8217;s easy to create a phpinfo() page you can use to get the version information. Open up a plain-text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit and add the following code:</p>
<pre>&lt;?php</pre>
<pre>phpinfo();

?&gt;</pre>
<p>Save this file as version.php (or anythingyouwant.php) and upload it to your web server using FTP to you web root directory. Then go to http://www.yoursite.com/version.php. Delete version.php from your server right away: you just want it to be available for a moment so you can get the information.</p>
<p>You now have your PHP version number. <strong>So now what?</strong></p>
<p>As of this writing, the current version of PHP is 5.2.5. If this is the version you have, congratulations! Your host is up to date with the latest stable copy of PHP there is. If you have a version of PHP that starts with 5 but isn&#8217;t the latest, check with your host to see if they&#8217;re in transition. A lot of hosts set aside some servers with PHP 5 when it first came out in July of 2004 for testing purposes. You might be on one of these servers.</p>
<p>If your PHP version is <strike>4.4.7</strike>4.4.8, your host has the latest stable version of PHP 4. Ask and see if they have a plan in place for upgrading your account to PHP 5. If your host is running a version of PHP earlier than 4.4.7, <strong>look for a new hosting provider immediately</strong>: your host is <em>at least</em> 7 months behind in applying security patches. Don&#8217;t count on them keeping you up to date in the future, they&#8217;ve already failed you.</p>
<p>As of this past Monday, no new versions of PHP 4 will be released and it is officially obsolete. On August 8th, the PHP team will not even release security updates for version 4.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: the PHP team released 4.4.8 the day after I posted this. The switch from .7 to .8 represents some security patches. It is not considered an entirely new version of PHP; everything should still be backwards compatible. If you are running 4.x.x, make sure your host upgrades you 4.4.8 promptly.</p>
<p>Aside from keeping up to date with software that&#8217;s being actively developed, there are other reasons to move to PHP 5. It performs faster and has new features your friendly open source programmers desperately want to use. The Joomla!, Drupal, and WordPress teams have all avoided writing code that only works on PHP 5 to make sure that you can run their software. Now is the time to return the favor and go with PHP 5!</p>
