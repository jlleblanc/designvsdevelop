<p><em>A huge <strong>thank you</strong> goes out to <a href="http://gnomeontherun.com/">Jeremy Wilken</a> for organizing the video recordings at JAB and uploading them!</em></p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/23941154">Here&#8217;s a direct link to Vimeo if the video doesn&#8217;t pull through.</a></p>
<p>I started off this year in the Philippines doing a missions internship. I packed all of my things into my car, parked it at my parents house, flew halfway around the world, then spent ten weeks working with missionaries. And I loved it. It was a chance to step away from writing code and spend time living in another culture.</p>
<p>And while I was there, I learned something very important about missionary work. You don’t just show up in a country and start a business, school, hospital, orphanage, or church. You meet people, build relationships, and learn from the people around you. You learn how business is done, you learn the local language, and you learn cultural expectations.</p>
<p>Only then do you work <em>alongside</em> nationals. And as you work, you train people. You train people not only until they can run something on their own, but until they start training others. Then you step back and let them own the work.</p>
<p>In contrast, when you run in and do everything on your own, your efforts become merely a means to an end. You create a dependency on yourself. Nationals are robbed of their dignity, believing they can’t do the work themselves. When you’re gone, the work you’ve done is over and nobody continues it.</p>
<p>There’s a direct correlation to the way missionaries must work and the way we approach volunteering for the Joomla project. If we contribute code to Joomla without learning from others, we won’t know what the expectations are. We won’t know what problems others are facing and we won’t know how to direct our efforts.</p>
<p>Worse, if we don’t put an effort into teaching, we’ll eventually become tired and burnt out. Other people in the community will become dependent on us and will never learn how to contribute to Joomla themselves. And when we’re gone, Joomla will fade away.</p>
<p>But if we approach the project ready to learn from each other and train each other, we’ll <em>never</em> have a shortage of people who are ready to maintain Joomla. And we’ll be accomplishing something far greater than simply maintaining Joomla: we’ll be launching new programmers, new designers, new webmasters, and new trainers. And people won’t just learn about Joomla, they’ll learn all of the tools and technologies that go into it.</p>
<p>We’re not here to build perfect software. There will be bugs in the tracker when we release 1.7, 1.8, 2.0, and every version of Joomla that will ever be released. There will always be features missing from the core, and there will always be old parts to do away with. But if we learn from each other, we can stop bugs before they happen. And if we train each other, there will be people ready to fix the ones that do crop up.</p>
<p>Twenty years from now, we won’t care about the way we implemented the Model-View-Controller design pattern in the Joomla Framework. We won’t care about how Joomla was licensed, and we certainly won’t care about Joomla vs. Drupal vs. WordPress. But we will care about the people we worked with, trained, and learned from.</p>
<p>Because the relationships we build through learning and teaching are Joomla’s True Merit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been in the United States for a couple of weeks now. The jet lag is over. A considerable amount of Mexican food has been consumed. Pennsylvania is in the middle of the “not quite winter, not quite spring” season. Facebook shows what all of my Filipino friends are doing, but it’s not the same as being there. And I’ve spent time reflecting on the internship as a whole.</p>
<p>Then one day, it hit me: this would have made the <em>perfect</em> reality TV series. We had team tasks every week, a host, a wide mix of people, and an unfamiliar environment. You could have rolled the cameras, added a few “honesty cam” interviews, and tied it all together with strategically placed music. Then we could have used royalties from the show to fund all of the missionaries!</p>
<p>Thankfully, the internship was <strong>not</strong> a reality TV series. Nobody was voted off <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panay">Panay Island</a> and nobody went home until the end. No one walked around with an attitude of “immunity.” <a href="http://anascomissions.org">Dave</a> was not ranking us and deciding who would be eliminated next.</p>
<p>The entire point of the internship was for us to grow and learn by doing things as a <em>team</em>. You can’t effectively do all of those things when you try to perform, show off, and make yourself noticed. You have to listen to everyone and think of them <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2%3A3&amp;version=NIV">as better than yourself</a>. And you have to rely on God’s power working through you, not your own talents and strengths.</p>
<p>So while nobody made a reality series based on our internship, there were cameras around. <a href="http://gotonations.org/adorada">Nomil</a> not only made a movie out of our footage, he also made a trailer!</p>
<p><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/W0VQy6P9TfQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/W0VQy6P9TfQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p><object width="640" height="390"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/EAf30ENYDDQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/EAf30ENYDDQ?fs=1&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>So, what’s next on the agenda? I’m never too far from the Joomla! community, so I’m returning to <a href="http://jandbeyond.org">J! and Beyond</a> for 2011. Then after three days of friends and geekery, I’m taking a side trip to pay a long overdue visit to <a href="http://mustardseedkosovo.blogspot.com/">Landon and Lacey</a> in Kosovo!</p>
