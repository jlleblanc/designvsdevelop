				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This coming Friday at 1PM Eastern US time, I&#8217;ll be giving a talk about Avoiding Joomla! Pain. Recently, I&#8217;ve been running into PHP programmers tasked with maintaining Joomla! sites they didn&#8217;t set up. Some dig in and get busy, while others become frustrated when things don&#8217;t work the way they expect. In this talk, I&#8217;ll go over a few things to help you get a handle on how Joomla! works and how to extend it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you don&#8217;t have to be anywhere near DC or even buy a ticket: it&#8217;s a part of the php|tek 2009 <a href="http://tek.mtacon.com/c/s/free-webcast-series">free webcast series</a>. You must <a href="https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/446886879">register</a> to see the webcast, but registration is free.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s something about Joomla! you&#8217;ve always wanted to know but have been afraid to ask, let me know in the comments and I&#8217;ll work it into the talk.</p>
