				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quick highlights from <a href="http://widgetdevcamp-dc.org/">Widget DevCamp DC</a> this past weekend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://zviband.com/">Zvi Band</a> did a presentation on creating Facebook Applications. When he was finished with his presentation, he created a Facebook App from scratch in PHP and FBML! It gave me a few ideas that I probably won&#8217;t get around to doing for a few months.</li>
<li>We had a roundtable discussion on making money with widgets. Some people proposed including Google ads, but others mentioned that this strategy tends not to work so well for such a small content set. It seems that the most viable route for &#8220;business widgets&#8221; is to use them for brand reinforcement.</li>
<li><a href="http://wendefer.blogspot.com/">Alex Eagle</a> demoed an application (based on Metro&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wmata.com">website</a>) he wrote for Google&#8217;s <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> project during DevCamp. While there aren&#8217;t any Andriod capable phones out yet, Google has the dev environment available with a phone emulator. There&#8217;s built in support for GPS, if you have a capable device. Looks very promising, but what will Apple&#8217;s iPhone kit offer? We shall see&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Widget DevCamp was much more relaxed and open ended than last summer&#8217;s BarCamp. We had a smaller crowd and more flexible schedule. I personally think we could have done the session planning on the same day: we did this during a Friday evening happy hour instead. The time constraints of doing everything on the same day keep things moving and prevent talks from dragging too long. However, I definitely enjoyed it and I&#8217;m looking forward to the next camp hitting DC: <a href="http://barcamp.org/eDemocracyCamp">eDemocracyCamp</a>.</p>
