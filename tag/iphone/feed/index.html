				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With Apple&#8217;s recent iPhone SDK release, the local tech scene is <a href="http://drinkingoatmealstout.com/2008/03/12/iphone-sdk-devcamp/">planning an event</a>. However, as some of the comments have pointed out, Apple&#8217;s licensing arrangement is a tad restrictive. This all sounds vaguely familiar. As it has been told to me, when Apple originally released the Macintosh, the software kit was expensive and exclusive: you could only buy your tools from Apple. This limited the availability of 3rd party Mac software, which in turn limited the adoption of the computer itself.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today with the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/">iPhone kit</a>. While the $99 for a full development license (allowing you to test on your iPhone instead of an emulator) isn&#8217;t exorbitant, it&#8217;s certainly a hurdle. The biggest offense though is the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2008/03/15/dlclaud115.xml">distribution system</a>. You are required to distribute your application through Apple&#8217;s site, have your application blessed by Steve Jobs, and only then do you get to keep 70% of the sales revenue.</p>
<p>Apple is trying to double dip in the upper right hand corner of the <a href="http://www.designvsdevelop.com/a-map-of-business-models-in-the-software-industry/">software business model map</a>: first by selling the iPhone, then by selling other people&#8217;s software products. Perhaps the <a href="http://www.kpcb.com/initiatives/ifund/index.html">iFund</a> they&#8217;ve arranged will soften the blow. My guess is that iPhone developers will move towards the upper left corner instead so that Apple will have less of a cut of their revenue. Why would an iPhone developer spend large resources on developing a rich iPhone app, only to hand 30% of their revenue to Apple?</p>
