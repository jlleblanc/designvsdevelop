				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally published my HowToJoomla.net tutorial on using <a href="http://www.howtojoomla.net/how-tos/development/how-to-track-your-joomla-project-with-git">Git with Joomla!</a>. I really struggled with trying to balance an introduction to version control, Git, and Joomla specific considerations, but I think the result was worth the time. One thing I would have liked to have covered would have been some of the GUIs that are available for Git, but that seemed to be a bit much for an intro article. By not covering the GUIs, I was able to focus on the core commands that everyone can use regardless of platform.</p>
<p>In any event, my hope is that this introduction will be useful not only to PHP developers, but also to template designers and site administrators. Any time you start writing even a single line of code is the right time to consider using version control as a part of your Joomla! workflow. It&#8217;s one of those tools you never knew to ask about; now you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>And if you want to see some Git and Joomla in action, don&#8217;t miss my talk at <a href="http://openca.mp/speakers/joe-leblanc/">OpenCamp</a>. It&#8217;s the same one I gave at JoomlaDay New England as well as J! and Beyond, so now Texans will be &#8216;git&#8217;ting too <img src="http://www.designvsdevelop.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
