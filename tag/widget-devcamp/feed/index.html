				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Quick highlights from <a href="http://widgetdevcamp-dc.org/">Widget DevCamp DC</a> this past weekend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://zviband.com/">Zvi Band</a> did a presentation on creating Facebook Applications. When he was finished with his presentation, he created a Facebook App from scratch in PHP and FBML! It gave me a few ideas that I probably won&#8217;t get around to doing for a few months.</li>
<li>We had a roundtable discussion on making money with widgets. Some people proposed including Google ads, but others mentioned that this strategy tends not to work so well for such a small content set. It seems that the most viable route for &#8220;business widgets&#8221; is to use them for brand reinforcement.</li>
<li><a href="http://wendefer.blogspot.com/">Alex Eagle</a> demoed an application (based on Metro&#8217;s <a href="http://www.wmata.com">website</a>) he wrote for Google&#8217;s <a href="http://code.google.com/android/">Android</a> project during DevCamp. While there aren&#8217;t any Andriod capable phones out yet, Google has the dev environment available with a phone emulator. There&#8217;s built in support for GPS, if you have a capable device. Looks very promising, but what will Apple&#8217;s iPhone kit offer? We shall see&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, Widget DevCamp was much more relaxed and open ended than last summer&#8217;s BarCamp. We had a smaller crowd and more flexible schedule. I personally think we could have done the session planning on the same day: we did this during a Friday evening happy hour instead. The time constraints of doing everything on the same day keep things moving and prevent talks from dragging too long. However, I definitely enjoyed it and I&#8217;m looking forward to the next camp hitting DC: <a href="http://barcamp.org/eDemocracyCamp">eDemocracyCamp</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech events in DC for 2008 are getting off to a fast start. First, there&#8217;s <a href="http://widgetdevcamp-dc.org/">Widget DevCamp DC</a> on January 25th (Friday evening) and 26th (all day Saturday). <a href="http://barcampdc.org">BarCamp DC</a> was a great time last Fall where lots of web/programming techniques were shared. Widget DevCamp hints that there may be some actual coding going on! (of course, this depends on who shows up and what ideas are kicked around).</p>
<p>The regular <a href="http://phpdc.org/">DC PHP Developer&#8217;s group</a> is scheduled to meet on February 13th. This will blow away all other tech events for the year, because we will be having a face-to-face text editor war! I&#8217;m so psyched! Go <a href="http://macromates.com">Textmate</a>!</p>
<p>Finally, Web Content Mavens will be having an <a href="http://webcms.meetup.com/39/calendar/7089391/">Open Source Content Management System</a> discussion on February 27th. I&#8217;ll be representing <a href="http://www.joomla.org">Joomla!</a>, <a href="http://www.caseysoftware.com">Keith Casey</a> will talk about <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>, and other people will talk about Alfresco, WordPress, and Textpattern.</p>
<p>See you at all of these events!</p>
