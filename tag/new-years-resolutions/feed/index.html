				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In January, my New Year&#8217;s resolution was to make more resolutions today: Chinese New Year. Solely because Chinese New Year is more than a month later.</p>
<p>So here goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go electronic/automatic with as much of my record keeping and business handling as possible. There are a lot of things I could be doing electronically but have still been doing on paper or through the mail. Also, I need to come up with a better system for handling recurring tasks and scheduling. If it comes down to it, I may end up with one of <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/">these</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">these</a>. <em>(sigh)</em></li>
<li>Rewrite the Daily Message tutorials, Podcast Suite, iWebCal, and my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLearning-Joomla-Extension-Development-Components%2Fdp%2F1847191304%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1181750928%26sr%3D8-9&amp;tag=jolle-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">book</a> to catch up with Joomla! updates. The latter should come out first.</li>
<li>Validate all of the markup on <a href="http://www.jlleblanc.com">jlleblanc.com</a>. Last year, I finally got on the whole semantic web bandwagon and haven&#8217;t fallen off yet. What was the catalyst for all of this? <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. When I saw how it was all CSS selector-based, DOM programming and the benefits of validated markup simultaneously made sense. The pursuit of validation is also helping me maintain Section 508 compliance at work.</li>
<li>Blog more and worry less about writing essays. When I started blogging, I actually wanted to start a site where I would keep a repository of opinions on specific topics, refined over time. This doesn&#8217;t really seem to work as people are much more familiar with off-the-cuff blog posts.</li>
<li>Incorporate.</li>
<li>Launch a major web-based service. Oh, so you&#8217;d like to know what&#8217;s cooking at Chez LeBlanc? You&#8217;ll just have to wait and see <img src="http://www.designvsdevelop.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </li>
</ul>
