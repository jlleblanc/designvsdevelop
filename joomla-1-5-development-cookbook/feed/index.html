		<description><![CDATA[Joe,

Appreciate you reviewing this book. I found the text to be good, but the method listings seem like so much filling. Over and over again, I&#039;m searching Joomla.org for the method that was not listed; or, for a human readable version of the method descriptions. 

Your book was a much better introduction, and James book is a good too. Both must be read in tandem to get the best learning -- not one or the other. Then, I&#039;m sure everyone does what I do, and that&#039;s dissect real extensions. 

Thanks Joe!
