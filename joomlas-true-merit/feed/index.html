I&#039;ve been designing just xhtml/css templates, I dabbled a bit in wordpress, and my next target is Joomla.  So I appreciate background information about Joomla, thanks again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just wanted to use this opportunity to thank you for your work with joomla and the lynda.com series on joomla. Your video tutorial was a door of enlightenment because now i&#039;m a joomla programmer and developer, i even read your book on creating custom components before getting myself acquainted with the MVC design pattern of joomla.

I hope you keep up the good work and help other people who need the information which you provide, it is of course priceless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great Presentation!  As a trainer of missionaries with New Tribes Mission, I can easily relate to your analogy and agree whole heartedly with making Joomla / and other opensource projects &quot;indigenous&quot;!  Good job.

Out of curiosity - what mission group were you travelling with?  I have lots of friends working in the Philippines.]]></description>
