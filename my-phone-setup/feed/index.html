		<description><![CDATA[For me, prepaid rules. I did a bit of research and discovered NET10 was the best for my purposes. I don’t use a lot of minutes — maybe 200 or so a month — and I’m not a mad texter or websurfer either, but 10¢ a minute for calls and 3¢ for texts is crazy good. And no fees per day or other bs.

I got a very nice Samsung phone with a slide-out qwerty keyboard and no one knows it’s prepaid. Costs me a big $30 a month for all my stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting article. I&#039;m in Canada and would love to do something about our phone bills. Canada is one of the most expensive countries in the world to operate a cell phone. The land lines are expensive too. I just finished paying the household utility bills including the phone bills today. My land line phone combined with the two cell phones operated in our house come to about $200/mth. This is insane. Granted, I have an iPhone which accounts for about $90 of this. So a little long distance on the land line and and iPhone equals &#039;time to get creative about how to use phones and bring the expenses down.&#039;

Thanks for taking the time to post this because it&#039;s inspiring and motivates me to start looking for better ways to deal with this. If I could save even 50% of what I am spending now it would be a significant savings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[On Straight Talk you get 1000 minutes and 1000 texts for $30.00pm prepaid. This works out at 2c per min and 1c per text, or the other way to work it out would be 3c per minute with 1000 free texts.]]></description>
