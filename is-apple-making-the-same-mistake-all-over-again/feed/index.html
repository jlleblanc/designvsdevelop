#1 So would you spend your energy on developing a) a fee-based web application formatted for mobile devices where you would keep 100% of your revenue or b) a iPhone specific application where you keep 70%?

#2 I can see the argument for the distribution/transactions, but that usually isn&#039;t more than %5-10 of your costs (thinking of CC charges, bandwidth, and some sort of mechanism to make sure that people can&#039;t *easily* copy around your code). Committing the remaining 20-25% to Apple&#039;s marketing and sales efforts seems to be a bit princely to me, especially when that&#039;s something *you* should want control over (even if you hire someone to do it).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Why would an iPhone developer spend large resources on developing a rich iPhone app, only to hand 30% of their revenue to Apple?&quot;

1. 70% of something is still more than 100% of nothing, which is the current iphone developer landscape.

2. 30% doesn&#039;t seem too bad of a charge for most of your marketing, distribution, and sales channel. With the app store a lot of those three areas of your business are covered.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah, the &quot;13 year old&quot; or &quot;quality control&quot; argument is still essentially Apple&#039;s elitism though. (Granted, a certain amount of this exclusiveness is what helps sell their products.)

The revenue cut is just a blatant money grab.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard some decent arguments for the entry fee - basically, with Apple allowing people to upload apps to their store, they want to keep the 13 year olds who aren&#039;t good programmers out (the argument was stated better than that).  Also, one could make a case for the developer split, but I&#039;m not as willing to buy that argument.  We&#039;ll see how it all plays out.]]></description>
