		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment!

I haven&#039;t had a chance to use it for a project yet, but I also give CodeIgniter a thumbs-up. Very well documented and it isn&#039;t doing a million things in the background without your knowledge.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Definitely the best analogy I heard about J and D. I played with Drupal a little, I can use it, but I find further customization too complicated. Well, I&#039;ve read similar opinions about Joomla, though, so it all depends on background.
For the time being I&#039;m staying with Joomla and other frameworks (like CodeIgniter) when needed.
btw: greetings to our man on the East coast!]]></description>
