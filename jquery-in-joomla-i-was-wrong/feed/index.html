		<description><![CDATA[Hi Joe, I have unfortunately found no other way to contact you. Do not be evil.
I only have one question about this post:
http://www.designvsdevelop.com/quick-and-dirty-christmas-list-a-joomla-recipe/#
At first this is a great work. This script is exactly what I was looking for. 
Did you continue this project? Unfortunately, there is still no good component for Joomla for this purpose.
Unfortunately, I&#039;m a PHP newbie. Can you tell me briefly explain how I ad a link in MYLIST to delete an entry? Where in the code you have to make a change?

Best wishes from Essen in Germany.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I build joomla template and I prefer using jquery rather than mootools. I have built several joomla templates with other noconflict method. But I still get complain about how its not loading and causing problem. 

After reading this article it is clear why it is happening. I will try out the fix you suggested and see if it works.
