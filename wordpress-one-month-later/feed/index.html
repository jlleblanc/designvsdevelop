		<description><![CDATA[Ok, reply to this comment to see if the plugin works.
About Akismet: I don&#039;t like to put too much web2 things on my wordpress too... but IMHO Akismet is mandatory. :)

About the themes: I suppose I said Joomla! has just a few of them because my customers always want a new one :-(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Carlo,

Thanks for the comments  :)

As far as the comment notifications go, wish granted! Let me know if it&#039;s working.

I would activate Akismet, but I try to avoid external services. I had some &quot;special sauce&quot; for the comments on my Joomla! based site; I may recreate some of it here. With the old one, I maybe got 1 spam every two weeks on a post from three months ago. So we&#039;ll see.

WordPress doesn&#039;t necessarily need an MVC architecture. However, it could do a lot better with the theming support.

As far as Joomla! not having many themes (templates), I&#039;ve experienced quite the opposite. I would venture to say that Joomla! has more templates than any other open source project.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello.
About the spam, I use Akismet and spam has gone a long time ago. :)
About the themes: there are many good themes (Joomla doesn&#039;t have many themes... unfortunately). You are right: there is not a MVC (both for plugin and themes... like Joomla does in 1.5).
May I suggest to add
http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments/
?
It helps commenters like me to follow the next comments.]]></description>
