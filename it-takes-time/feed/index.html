		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the honesty in regards to your trip Joe. All good and valid thoughts, many of which I experienced on my first trip to Africa. Many people don&#039;t come to those same conclusions and wonder why development doesn&#039;t happen faster, but I&#039;m glad you had that experience.

Your vision was solid, and yes, revolutionary, but you came to the right conclusion. It takes time. My hope is that your vision didn&#039;t end there but will continue to live on. The Philippines needs your vision badly. Should you decide to move forward with that idea, let me know. I have a special interest in that area.

Thanks again for sharing.]]></description>
