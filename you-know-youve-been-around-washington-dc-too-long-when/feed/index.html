		<description><![CDATA[Although we&#039;ve known each other only a few years, somehow it feels as if we&#039;ve been friends a lot longer than that. Revel in your new adventure and know that your friends will always be here. Thanks for helping to get the NoVA JUG off the ground and soaring to new heights. We couldn&#039;t have done it without you. I am sure I speak for our entire JUG membership (and likely a lot of the Joomla! community) when I say &quot;We wish you well.&quot; Keep in touch. ;) Ciao!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just finished your training video on Joomla! Essentials at Lynda.com. As a result I decided to check your website and I am thrilled to learn you are heeding this call on your life. Here is a word of encouragement:
Luke 5:9-11 =&gt;
&quot;For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken; and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, &#039;Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.&#039; So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him.&quot;
Go, Go, Go - there are more important things in life that require your attention. ¡ Via Con Dios !]]></description>

Thanks for taking a chance in me. I have learned so much in the time working with you and I have learned that to appreciate Joomla more. I am looking forward to working with you again in the future.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@JoeJoomla thanks. And yes, from what I&#039;m told, &quot;minimum wage&quot; in the Philippines is approximately $50 a month.


We&#039;ll see where this leads, but I don&#039;t think it will entirely take me away from the code ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a great opportunity Joe.

I hope you are received and treated well in Iloilo City.

It&#039;s always great to get a perspective from the outside looking in. I&#039;m sure many people will read your comments like &quot;$1,200 a month is a pretty good deal on an apartment&quot; and wonder what you are talking about. But it IS a big deal.

People forget, or maybe don&#039;t even realize that the majority of the people on the planet could never afford to pay that. Although there are many very rich people in the world, according to wisegeek.com, &quot;The median income worldwide — the amount that is dead middle between the least and the highest amounts — is $850 US Dollars (USD). People who have incomes of $41,000 USD are in the top 3% in terms of the richest people in the world.&quot;

I like what Lilly Tomlin once said; &quot;In the ratrace, even if you win, you&#039;re still a rat&quot;

So kudos to you for jumping off the treadmill and making a change, even if it&#039;s only for a short while. Most people never do this.
