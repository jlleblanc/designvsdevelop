		<description><![CDATA[I am a member of lynda and have been trying to figure out which CMS I should use. I have been using WordPress for many of my projects but WPs offerings are limited (or at least different) compared to Drupal and Joomla. My office is having me learn Drupal. Tom&#039;s tutorial is great! I went through the whole thing and feel like I have a solid understanding of the workflow.
HOWEVER, there is no Lynda.com tutorial for building Drupal Themes! As a designer, by far learning how to &quot;theme&quot; is the most important factor in which CMS to use. There is a Joomla tutorial on theme templates, and I will take that one very soon. Right now I am focusing on learning Drupal theme building and styling and I have come a long way. But I would love to see a tutorial on building Drupal themes on Lynda.com.]]></description>
