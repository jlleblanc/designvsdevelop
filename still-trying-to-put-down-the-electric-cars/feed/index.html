No thought whatsoever to changing our cars to run off of the plants.  Now nuclear shouldn&#039;t be accepted willy nilly, but the clean air advantages to nuclear power may be a good stopgap measure until we perfect another method, espicially if we start running our cars on the grid.]]></description>
